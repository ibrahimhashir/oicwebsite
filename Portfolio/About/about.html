      <div class="text-center h2 text-uppercase"> about me</div>
      <div class="text-center text-capitalize ">Hey, this is my homepage, so I have to say something about myself. Sometimes it is hard to introduce yourself because you know yourself so well that you do not know where to start with. Let me give a try to see what kind of image you have about me through my self-description. I hope that my impression about myself and your impression about me are not so different. Here it goes.</div>

        <p class="h2 text-capitalize">my name is  <span  clas="ttext text-decoration h1">Ibrahim Hashir</span></p>
        <p>Hi, my name is Ibrahim Hahsir, I am PHP developer. I have been at OiC for some months now, and have thoroughly enjoyed myself here. The school is great, the people are fantastic and the atmosphere is one that makes you actually want to go to coding school. Before I joined OIC I was studying at Vsoft School for more than 4 months. I was born and raised in Lagos and grew up there.</p>
        <p>I am an interesting, fun loving guy with a good sense of humor. One thing about me that is important to know though is that at first I come of as a very shy individualistic guy but once I get to know people and are comfortable with my environment I am great. It is hard for me to make friends but once I make them, it’s great and I am all different. I joke, laugh and humor people and I also get as much as I give. I am a very kind, compassionate, sensitive guy as my close friends will tell you. I have a tough shell but on the inside I am soft. I am also a very principled person and stand strong on what is right and wrong. I am also a very straight and honest person. I understand and know that we all put on a show sometimes and do not show who we really are or what we feel but some people do this constantly and those kinds of people I cannot stand.</p>
        I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read Qur'an, I like to write; I like to think, I like to code , I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night. I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. I like to sleep early, I like to get up late; I like to be alone, I like to be surrounded by good people. I like country’s peace, I like metropolis’ noise; I like the beautiful west lake in Hangzhou, I like the flat cornfield in Champaign. I like delicious food and comfortable shoes; I like good books. I like the land and the nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh always.
